Tracks revenue from January to May.
Shows fluctuations in monthly revenue with a peak in May ($9.18M) and a dip in February ($8.56M).

The dashboard provides a solid overview of retail performance across time, teams, regions, and products. It is effective for executive decision-making, especially in identifying high-performing products, sales regions, and top personnel.

## Recommendation

I would recommend the company to focus on boosting underperforming categories like Sports, invest more in top-performing ones like Decoratives, and recognize high-achieving sales reps to drive overall revenue growth.
